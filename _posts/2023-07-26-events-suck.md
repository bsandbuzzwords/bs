For some unknown reasons events and tradeshows are back with a vengeance after a nice break during covid. One of the only benefits of covid was having events go virtual so you didn’t need to get dragged to some generic event, make awkward smalltalk with your colleagues while you collected branded swag from companies getting screwed to exhibit at the events. The ironic thing is that the swag fits perfectly into the same trash can that one of your new “leads” is also yakking in from being hammered.

Events now lure you in with “expert” speakers to help “level-up” your skill set. What the event organizers don’t tell you is that these “expert” speakers are actually sponsors who paid thousands of dollars to be featured. We see this act as no different than paying to get your kids into a top-notch college.

We were recently at an ecommerce event where one of the panelists was a marketing director of a brand founded by an “influencer” with millions of followers. The moderator of the panel asked him “how he was able to grow the brand.” Let’s see, it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure this one out….the brand is founded by an influencer with millions of followers.

As the marketing director was spewing bullshit and buzzwords all over the crowd, we looked around and saw attendees actually taking notes on what this clown was saying. Are we missing something? While this is not a verbatim conversation between the marketing director and the influencer, we suspect this is what a slack exchange looks like for him and his founder when he needed “growth:”

**Marketing Director**: “Hey! Our sales are down a bit, can you make a post and tag our brand.”<br>
**Influencer**: “Sure! Let me go look sexy on a beach and hold up the product and tag us!!”<br>
**Marketing Director**: “Perfect! Ty!”<br>
*Waits 4 hours after the post is made<br>
**Marketing Director**: “Hey! That post generated $67K in new revenue!”<br>

This is TOTALLY repeatable for any brand! Yup, fly from all over the world to hear insightful conversations like this.
