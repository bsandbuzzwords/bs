Being married to Matt Gaetz should be enough to earn Ginger Gaetz the Bullshit artist of the week every week by proximity alone, but she earns it herself this week with her laughable Instagram post complaining that the Barbie movie (a movie about a CHILD'S DOLL) did not address “any notion of faith or family”. This is a summer movie about a doll for christ sake and is meant to be funny, and make fun of itself. It is not meant to be taken seriously, much like your husband Matt Gaetz who is one step away from being thrown in jail for sexual trafficking of minors.

The hypocrisy of these people knows no bounds. These people like Matt and Ginger Gaetz who “rail against the elites” end up getting invited (and attend) a movie premiere? How is that not elitism in and of itself?

Elitism is the belief or notion that individuals who form an elite—a select group of people perceived as having an intrinsic quality, high intellect, wealth, power, notability, special skills, or experience—are more likely to be constructive to society as a whole, and therefore deserve influence or authority greater than that of others.

Maybe Margot Robbie’s next role will be as Ginger Gaetz in the movie “Predator,” starring Steve Buscemi as Matt Gaetz. Then Ginger can complain that, like Barbie, that movie also neglects any notion of family or faith.
