We (as in **Salt Master Flex** and **Saltimus Prime**) met at one of those “rocket ships” or “unicorn” startups (aka what every startup proclaims to be). You know the type of startups where bro’s and biddies walk around in branded gear blinded by the free snacks, cool offices and great perks.

While we enjoyed those free snacks and perks, we bonded over just how short-sighted and neurotic most of the people around us were when it came to actually doing work (you know, the reason as to why we were there to begin with). For example, we often wondered why we were spending 30 hours a week sitting in meetings, creating reports (that nobody actually looked at) and talking about what we were doing vs. actually doing work. Oh, and not to mention how Salt Master Flex always used to crush Saltimus Prime in NBA Hangtime. Prime had no answer for Dino Radjas mid-court threes.

We started salting (aka shit talking) about everything around us and realized that this was not an issue confined to this “unicorn” after we separately left that company because we were recruited to work for other similar “rocket ships.” We realized that people as a whole have gotten dumber, more self-centered and full of shit. From the endless self promoting and rants on social media to the meetings that they were being dragged into about nothing to working with dumber and dumber people (but hey, you aren’t looked at as dumb if you are loud and authoritative in endless “deep dive” meetings where you are “circling back” to move the “big rocks,” you are looked at as strategic).

Bullshit and Buzzwords is bringing to life our text banter where we mock today's working culture. We hope to bring a smile to the faces of those people that have not become too drunk with corporate kool-aid and are experiencing this on a daily basis.

While we aren’t intending to personally attack individuals that we may call out, we are instead using these individuals as an example of a salty take that we have. So if you get offended that you are a subject of one of our bullshit dumps, know that you are just the lucky poster child of our dumps and we came across your bullshit first :). Maybe think twice next time before posting something on a publicly available social network.

We hope that you get a chuckle or two as you navigate this working world full of bullshit and buzzwords. Finally, we think that paying for marketing in general is bullshit and would love to grow this thing organically with our salty takes (aka we like organic salt). So please share this newsletter with your friends, family and salty co-workers :).

Thanks,

Salt Master Flex and Saltimus Prime.
